				<h3>Video Games</h3>
					<p>I started playing video games when I was in 5th grade when my mother finally bought me a PS3 and I remmeber loving them. I used to have games like lego batamn and WWE smackdown Vs Raw 2010 which were both very fun to play. I used to be someone with a "you never try you never fail" aditude but surprisingly whenever I got stuck on a level I never actually gave up I just took a break and was right back on it. In recent years I've seen that more and more when I started to play a game called sekiro which is really challenging and while I never finished it I surely intend to. I guess in a way video games taught me to be determined but also to know when you need a break and there is no shame in needing to recharge.</p>
					<p> I currently have a Xbox One S.</p>

				<h3>Audio/Video editing</h3>
					<p>I always wanted to become a youtuber when I was young. The way they always made me laugh or think was something I strived to do for others. I recently tried again a few months ago near the start of 2020 and I realized that the quality was severely lacking. I decided I wanted a new editing software to replace me using Imovie. I eventually started to use Kinemaster and It went surprisingly well. I still edit my audio on voicememos but overtime I got surprisingly more efficiant at it. The process wasn't exactly hard but it was very tedious especially the audio and for longer videos. I was however really passionate about making these videos so I was able to make them and they came out great (in my opinion). I also learned determination from this and that if your really passionate about something it can give you the enrgy to go through things even if they seem tedious or difficult. </p>
					<p> My favorite Youtuber is CoryXKenshin because of how wholesome that he is and yet still so entertaining. I see him as a role model and I aspire to be able to do the things he does for people</p>

				<h3>Song Writing</h3>
					<p>I always liked music. In recent years I decided to start singing and rapping as a hobby because I like what music does for me and I want that for other people (same as the youtube thing). I picked up on the patterns of my favorite rappers and singers and I take that into account when writing my songs. I learned from song writing to take inspiration from others and make it your own.</p>
					<p> My favorite rapper is Daniel Rustage who does anime raps on youtube. I like him because he was the first ani-rapper I listened to on youtube and he is really good so I attribute my love of ani-rap to him.<p>

				<h3>Boxing</h3>
					<p>I was never really a fighter but I always thought I needed to know how to defend myself. I was bullied in school as well so I was ready for a fight if need be but I was just going off stuff I saw from shows and movies with only a little knowedge of the actual science and fundamentals of the craft. I started going to the gym a few years ago and one thing that immediently caught my eye was their boxing programs. I wanted to learn for a long time but at the time I wasn't old enough to do it at the old gym I used to go to. I recently went to a Gym called Nine Rounds which was heavily boxing oriented and was run by a former pro boxer who is also my barber. By the point I started going I was adept at working out so I thought it was going to be fairly easy. Little did I know I went through one rotation and I was completely out of it. I also had to learn the termonology they used like hook and cross. I wasn't very good at first but by that point I learned that if I was gonna survive working out I needed to have drive to keep me going. I learned determination from learning how to box and to have quick thinking because if you can't think on your feet you'll be taken off them.</p>
